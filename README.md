# sms_spam_detector
 In this challenge, an SMS text classification solution will be refactored into a function that constructs and trains a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Once trained, a Gradio app will be created to host the model, allowing users to input text messages and receive feedback on whether the message is classified as spam or not.
